    <h1>The Secret</h1>

    <p><strong>The Secret</strong> is a 2006 Australian-American spirituality documentary consisting of a series of interviews designed to demonstrate the New Thought belief that everything one wants or needs can be satisfied by believing in an outcome, repeatedly thinking about it, and maintaining positive emotional states to "attract" the desired outcome.
    The film and the subsequent publication of the book of the same name attracted interest from media figures such as Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres and Larry King.</p>
    <p>The Secret, described as a self-help film,[3][4] uses a documentary format to present a concept titled "law of attraction". As described in the film, the "Law of Attraction" hypothesis[5] posits that feelings and thoughts can attract events, feelings, and experiences, from the workings of the cosmos to interactions among individuals in their physical, emotional, and professional affairs. The film also suggests that there has been a strong tendency by those in positions of power to keep this central principle hidden from the public.</p>
    <p>The film includes interviews with individuals who describe themselves as professionals and authors in the fields of quantum physics, psychology, metaphysics, coaching, theology, philosophy, finance, feng shui, medicine, and personal development, who are called "secret teachers". Some of them, on their websites, promote the film and their connection to it. A few of the persons' brief appearances do not speak of the "law of attraction" in their interviews, so their support of the concepts is assumed by viewers.
    People who focus on the law of attraction who are interviewed in the film and have later been featured on prominent American TV shows are John Assaraf,[6] Michael Beckwith,[7] John Demartini,[8] Bob Proctor,[9] Jack Canfield,[10] James Arthur Ray, Joseph Vitale,[11] Lisa Nichols, Marie Diamond, John Gray and Bob Doyle. Others involved in the film who have spoken of their strong belief in the Law of Attraction, include Esther Hicks and Jerry Hicks[12] (original edition only),[13] Mike Dooley, David Schirmer, and Marci Shimoff. Others interviewed in the film who voice very similar views without using the phrase "law of attraction" include Lee Brower (board member of WorldVuer), Hale Dwoskin, Bob Doyle, Cathy Goodman, Morris E. Goodman, John Hagelin, Bill Harris,[14] Ben Johnson,[15] Loral Langemeier, Denis Waitley, Neale Donald Walsch, John Gray and Fred Alan Wolf. NY Times bestselling authors of The Passion Test, Janet Bray Attwood and Chris Attwood, are not featured in the film, but they arranged 36 of the 52 interviews done for the movie.[16] The Attwoods are included in the credits at the end of the film.</p>
