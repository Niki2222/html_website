    <h1>The Green Mile</h1>
    <img src="images/green.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The Green Mile Is Based On A Truth-Inspired Stephen King Book. While not a true story, The Green Mile is based on a book. The heart and plot of the book remain intact for the movie adaptation. However, some changes were made to prevent the film from being "too sad" (if that can be believed).</p>
    <p>Cited as featuring one of the saddest endings in movie history, The Green Mile would be a grave omission for a list on this topic. John Coffey is an innocent man accused of raping and killing two girls.</p>
