        <p><strong>In time</strong> is one of my favorites because of the idea of being young always.</p>
        <p><strong>The secret</strong> is one of the movies that have changed my life.</p>
        <p><strong>Just go with it</strong> it's a tupid comedy that always makes me laugh.</p>
        <p><strong>Something borrowed</strong> is kind of what's going on in real life.</p>
        <p><strong>The green mile</strong> is really sad, but somehow has marked me.</p>
